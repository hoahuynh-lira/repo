"markdown":"###Enjoy Dark Mode To The Fullest\n\nDarkPapers is a tweak that adds over 50 OLED friendly and Full HD day and night wallpapers, with many more coming in future updates, into the iOS 13 native dark mode wallpaper cycle, also natively called as apperance aware. No setting up is required, simply install the tweak and go to the wallpaper section in the settings app and look in the still wallpapers to see your new dark mode compatible wallpapers. Or, alternatively, download WallpaperLoader Prefs to set your own custom wallpapers, which is a different tweak from WallpaperLoader.\n\n###Wallpapers In This Pack\n\nThis pack includes all the wallpapers from all packs, although the standalone wallpapers in this pack are: **Catalina 1, Cyber Retro 1, Cyber Retro 2, Cyber Retro 3, Japanese 1, Japanese 2, Japanese 3, and Vilyuchinsky 1.**\n\n###Dependencies\n\nThis package depends on **WallpaperLoader** in order to work, which you can get in the repository of Skittyblock at [skitty.xyz/repo](https://skitty.xyz/repo)\n\nAll wallpapers included in this package are free to use. I do not own any rights above them and the credit goes to the original creators. The only changes made to these wallpapers by me were to tweak the darkness and color in some of them and to modify their original size.\n\n###Compatibility\n\nThis package is compatible with **iOS 13 and above**. The wallpapers included in the tweak are **NOT sized for iPads**, only for iPhones. iPad users can use the WallpaperLoader Prefs tweak which is a different tweak that lets you use your own custom day and night wallpapers, that is also available in the same repository as WallpaperLoader, or simply wait until the **next update that adds iPad compatibility**.\n\n###Known Issues\n\nThere's a harmless bug that when you preview one of the custom day and night wallpapers while enabling or disabling dark mode, it will zoom in on the wallpaper, but you can still select it, as it won't be zoomed in once applied, it only appears so in the preview. To fix it, simply stop previwing the wallpaper and then preview it again.",
